Tiny AI companions that live on your macOS dock.

**Bruce** and **Jazz** walk back and forth above your dock. Click one to open an AI terminal. They walk, they think, they vibe.

Supports **Claude Code**, **OpenAI Codex**, **GitHub Copilot**, and **Google Gemini** CLIs — switch between them from the menubar.

  - [OpenAI Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) — `npm install -g @openai/codex`

## privacy

lil agents runs entirely on your Mac and sends no personal data anywhere.

- **Your data stays local.** The app plays bundled animations and calculates your dock size to position the characters. No project data, file paths, or personal information is collected or transmitted.
- **AI providers.** Conversations are handled entirely by the CLI process you choose (Claude, Codex, Copilot, or Gemini) running locally. lil agents does not intercept, store, or transmit your chat content. Any data sent to the provider is governed by their respective terms and privacy policies.
- **No accounts.** No login, no user database, no analytics in the app.
- **Updates.** lil agents uses Sparkle to check for updates, which sends your app version and macOS version. Nothing else.
